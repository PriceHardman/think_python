# Exercise 12-3.
# Write a function called  most_frequent that takes a string and prints the letters in deÂ­
# creasing order of frequency. Find text samples from several different languages and see
# how letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with the tables at
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies.
