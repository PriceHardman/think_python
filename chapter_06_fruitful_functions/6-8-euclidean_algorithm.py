# Exercise 6-8.
# The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides both
# of them with no remainder.
# One way to find the GCD of two numbers is Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which is based on
# the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then
# gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.
# Write a function called  gcd that takes parameters  a and  b and returns their
# greatest common divisor. If you need help, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
# Euclidean_algorithm.

def gcd(a,b):
    if b==0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b,a%b)

# Test
a = int(input("Enter an integer:"))
b = int(input("Enter another integer:"))
print("The greatest common divisor of",a,"and",b,"is",gcd(a,b))
