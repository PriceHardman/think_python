# Exercise 16-3.
# Write a correct version of increment that doesnâ€™t contain any loops.
# That is, write a function that takes two arguments, a time object, and an integer representing a number of seconds,
# and modify the original time object by adding that number of seconds to it.

    seconds_to_add = int(seconds % 60)
    time.hour += hours_to_add
    time.minute += minutes_to_add
    time.second += seconds_to_add
