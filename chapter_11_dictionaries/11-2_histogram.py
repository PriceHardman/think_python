# Exercise 11-2.
# Dictionaries have a method called  get that takes a key and a default value. If the key
# appears in the dictionary,  get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the
# default value. For example:
# >>> h = histogram('a')
# >>> print h
# {'a': 1}
# >>> h.get('a', 0)
# 1
# >>> h.get('b', 0)
# 0
# Use  get to write  histogram more concisely. You should be able to eliminate the  if
# statement.

def histogram(s):
    d = {}
    for c in s:
        d[c]=d.get(c,1)
    return d
